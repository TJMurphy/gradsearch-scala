He is particularly interested in the analysis of protein and RNA structure and function, both in an individual problem-centered manner and on a functional genomic scale.  He has an interest in applying systems biology concepts to pharmacology and personalized medicine.  His core initial work was the development of probabilistic algorithms for the determination of protein structure from sparse and uncertain experimental data. These algorithms have been shown to have some advantages over other methods of structure determination including the ability to calculate not only a protein conformation, but also an explicit estimate of the uncertainty in the position of each atom.His current efforts are in three areas.First, he is interested in techniques for representing biological knowledge (not just data) for automatic scientific computation. His group is working on representing the contents of the scientific literature for pharmacogenomics (http://www.pharmgkb.org/) in order to support the task of building robust models of biological systems. As part of this work, the group is also interested in novel user interfaces to biological data, and computational architectures for knowledge environments.Second, he is interested in the analysis of microenvironments within macromolecules. In particular, his group is developing methods for statistically analyzing related structures to infer the key conserved features that distinguish these structures from unrelated structures. This work has implications for the recognition of functional sites in proteins, for protein engineering, and for drug design (http://feature.stanford.edu/).Finally, he is interested in physics-based simulation of biological structures, particularly RNA and proteins. Within this broad area, our focus has been on creating coarse-grain representations of RNA, and on combining machine learning and informatics methods with simulation to maximize the performance of each (http://simbios.stanford.edu/).", "department": "Bioengineering", "lab_website": "http://soe.stanford.edu/research/layout.php?sunetid=rbaltman", "keywords": ["bioinformatics", "pharmacogenomics", "simulation", "medical informatics", "structural bioinformatics", "rna structure & function", "protein structure & function", "machine learning", "natural language processing", "knowledge representation"]},

To accomplish this, we synthesize the molecular and nanoscopic systems, build the analytial tools and develop the theoretical understanding with which to study electron transfer between electrodes and among redox species through insulating molecular bridges. Members of the group have synthesized several series of saturated and conjugated oligomers with which we have studied the fundamental aspects of electron tunneling through well-defined molecular bridges. The oligophenylenevinylene bridge of these molecules promotes rapid tunneling over remarkably long distances compared with other unsaturated and saturated bridges we have studied. For instance, starting in the activated complex, the tunneling rate between a gold electrode and an appended ferrocene through 3.5nm of an oligophenylenevinylene (OPV) bridge is 8 x 10 9 s-1 whereas the tunneling rate through an alkane bridge of the same length is expected to be slower than 1s -1.To date our electron-tunneling studies have largely focused on what we casually denote as a \"one-electrode\" measurement with the molecular bridge connecting one electrode to a redox species which acts as a molecular capacitor to an ionically conducting solution. The other electrodes necessary to measure the tunneling conduction are remotely located in an electrochemical cell. We are currently embarked on a broad based effort to make conduction measurements with two electrodes, one on each end of a single molecule. We are also developing strategies to include one or more additional electrodes so that molecular circuits with electrical power gain can be assembled. This effort is leading us to develop nanostructured wiring schemes and self-assembly methods for the construction of whole circuits of wired molecules.

(Dick) Cottle was born in Chicago in 1934. He received his elementary and high school education in the neighboring village of Oak Park. Dick enrolled at Harvard College to take up political science and premedical studies in order to become a physician (or possibly a foreign service officer if that didn't work out). As it happened, both of these alternatives were abandoned because he was strongly attracted to mathematics and ultimately received his bachelor's degree in that field. He stayed on at Harvard and received the master's degree in mathematics in 1958. This was the Sputnik era, and Dick was moved by a passion to teach secondary-level mathematics. In the first of a series of fateful decisions, he joined the Mathematics Department at the Middlesex School in Concord, Massachusetts where for two years he taught grades 7-12. Midway through this period he married his wife Suzanne (Sue). At this time he began to think of returning to graduate school for a doctorate in mathematics. He decided to study geometry at the University of California at Berkeley and was admitted there. Just before leaving Middlesex, Dick received a telephone call from the Radiation Laboratory at Berkeley offering him the part- time job as a computer programmer for which he had applied. Through this job, he became aware of linear and quadratic programming and the contributions of George Dantzig and Philip Wolfe. Before long, Dick left the Rad Lab to join Dantzig's team at the Operations Research Center at UC Berkeley.Under the tutelage of George Dantzig (and the late Edmund Eisenberg), Dick developed a symmetric duality theory and what was then called the \"composite problem\". These topics along with a re\u00ebxamination of the Fritz John conditions, formed the core of his doctoral dissertation. The composite problem involved a fusion of the primal and dual first-order optimality conditions. It was realized that the resulting inequality system could be studied without reference to the primal-dual structure out of which it was born. The name \"complementarity problem\" was suggested by Dick and introduced in a joint paper with Habetler and Lemke. After Berkeley, Dick's work took two closely related directions. One was the study of quadratic programming; the other was what we now call \"linear complementarity\". The interesting role played by classes of matrices in both these areas has always held a special fascination for Dick. In quadratic programming, for instance, with Jacques Ferland he obtained characterizations of quasi- and pseudo-convexity of quadratic functions. Dick (and others) were quick to recognize the importance of matrix classes in linear complementarity theory. It was he who proposed the name \"copositive-plus\" for a matrix class that arose in Lemke's seminal paper of 1965. The name first appeared in the classic paper of Cottle and Dantzig called \"Complementary Pivot Theory of Mathematical Programming\". The subjects of quadratic programming and linear complementarity (and the associated matrix theory) remain central to his research interests.", "department": "Management Science and Engineering", "lab_website": "http://soe.stanford.edu/research/layout.php?sunetid=rwc", "keywords": ["mathematical programming (optimization)"]},

We use spin casting, Langmuir-Blodgett deposition, and surface grafting to fabricate ultrathin films in the range of 100 to 1000 Angstroms thick. Macromolecular amphiphiles are examined at the air-water interface by surface pressure, Brewster angle microscopy, and interfacial shear measurements and on solid substrates by atomic force microscopy, FTIR, and ellipsometry. A vapor-deposition-polymerization process has been developed for covalent grafting of poly(amino acids) from solid substrates. FTIR measurements permit study of secondary structures (right and left-handed alpha helices, parallel and anti-parallel beta sheets) as a function of temperature and environment.</p>Interface Science of Biomolecular Materials</b><br/>The cell membrane is a wonderfully complex structure having a phospholipids matrix with a wide variety of associated and integral membrane proteins. We are exploring highly simplified analogues of the cell membrane for possible applications in bioanalytical devices. Vesicles or liposomes of phospholipids are prepared by sonication or membrane extrusion and characterized by dynamic light scattering. The kinetics of adsorption of these vesicles on a solid substrate followed by fusion to form a continuous supported bilayer is followed by the quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation. This instrument allows determination of both the mass deposition as well as the viscoelastic coupling of the adsorbed film with the surrounding fluid. Fluorescence recovery after pattern photobleaching is used to monitor the lateral diffusivity of labeled lipids.</p>Polymer Development of an Artificial Cornea Based on Polymer Hydrogels</b><br/>A broadly interdisciplinary collaboration has been established with the Department of Ophthalmology in the Stanford School of Medicine. We have designed and synthesized a fully interpenetrating network of two different hydrogel materials that have properties consistent with application as a substitute for the human cornea: high water swellability up to 85%,tensile strength comparable to the cornea, high glucose permeability comparable to the cornea, and sufficient tear strength to permit suturing. We have developed a technique for surface modification with adhesion peptides that allows binding of collagen and subsequent growth of epithelial cells. Broad questions on the relationships among molecular structure, processing protocol, and biomedical device application are being pursued.</p>To view a list of his Professorships, see his <a href=\"http://chemenew.stanford.edu/faculty/profiles/cwfrank/cwfrank.html\">department page</a>.</p>", "department": "Chemical Engineering", "lab_website": "http://soe.stanford.edu/research/layout.php?sunetid=cwfrank", "keywords": ["polymer physics", "molecular assemblies", "optics", "photonics"]},

In the case of polymeric liquids, it is of interest to obtain in situ measurements of segmental orientation and optical methods have proven to be an excellent means of acquiring this information. Research in our laboratory has resulted in a number of techniques in optical rheometry such as high-speed polarimetry (birefringence and dichroism) and various microscopy methods (fluorescence, phase contrast, and atomic force microscopy).Elegant flow-processing techniques have been developed to produce organized, biocompatible structures for applications in tissue engineering. Collagen, protein commonly found in load-bearing tissues, possesses the unique ability to organize into complex ordered structures due to its liquid crystalline properties. The result is an oriented substrate of collagen capable of inducing cellular level control. It has been observed that cells will respond to the substrate\u0092s ordered microstructure by polarizing themselves to align in the direction of flow deposition. Another application of orientation dynamics is in the development of solar cells. The efficiency of second-generation solar cells fabricated with conjugated polymers is limited by photoelectron transport within the polymer film. Inspired by electrorheological fluids, an external electric field is applied to the film to induce anisotropy in polymer crystallites, which is expected to enhance electron mobility. The microstructure of polymeric and other complex materials also cause them to have interesting physical properties and respond to different flow conditions in unusual manners.  In our laboratory, we are equipped with instruments that are able to characterize these materials such as shear rheometer, capillary break up extensional rheometer, and 2D extensional rheometer.  Then, the response of these materials to different flow conditions can be visualized and analyzed in detail using high speed imaging devices at up to 2,000 frames per second.  Interfacial Dynamics and Rheology</b>There are numerous processes encountered in nature and industry where the deformation of fluid-fluid interfaces is of central importance. Examples from nature include deformation of the red blood cell in small capillaries, cell division and structure and composition of the tear film. Industrial applications include the processing of emulsions and foams, and the atomization of droplets in ink-jet printing. In our laboratory, fundamental research is in progress to understand the orientation and deformation of monolayers at the molecular level. These experiments employ state of the art optical methods such as polarization modulated dichroism, fluorescence microscopy, and Brewster angle microscopy to obtain in situ measurements of polymer films and small molecule amphiphile monolayers subject to flow. Langmuir troughs are used as the experimental platform so that the thermodynamic state of the monolayers can be systematically controlled. For the first time, well characterized, homogeneous surface flows have been developed, and real time measurements of molecular and microdomain orientation have been obtained. These microstructural experiments are complemented by measurements of the macroscopic, mechanical properties of the films.", "department": "Chemical Engineering", "lab_website": "http://soe.stanford.edu/research/layout.php?sunetid=ggf", "keywords": ["structure and dynamics of complex fluids and interfaces"]},

Global dependence on fossil fuels, however, will persist until alternate technologies can compete economically. We must develop means to produce energy (or energy carriers) from renewable sources and then convert them to work as efficiently and cleanly as possible. Catalysis is energy conversion, and the Jaramillo laboratory focuses on fundamental catalytic processes occurring on solid-state surfaces in both the production and consumption of energy. Chemical-to-electrical and electrical-to-chemical energy conversion are at the core of the research. Nanoparticles, metals, alloys, sulfides, nitrides, carbides, phosphides, oxides, and biomimetic organo-metallic complexes comprise the toolkit of materials that can help change the energy landscape. Tailoring catalyst surfaces to fit the chemistry is our primary challenge.</p>Fuel Cells</strong><br />A fuel cell is a promising energy conversion device in which chemical energy is directly converted to electrical energy, for example: H2 + 1/2O2 &#8594; H2O, DG = -1.23 eV. Despite the attractiveness of fuel cell technologies, a number of materials-related problems have hindered their wide-spread use. Projects in this area are geared for the development of promising new electrocatalytic materials by studying fundamental electrochemical surface phenomena, with the ultimate aim of overcoming the technological challenges in fuel cell catalysis. In the case of Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells, the greatest challenge is the cathode, where much of the cell voltage must be \"consumed\" in order to drive the sluggish reaction kinetics of the Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR), O2 + 4H+ + 4e- &#8594; 2H2O. The potential at which the cathode operates is also problematic, as unwanted surface chemistry is often induced, including surface oxidation, poisoning by OH- adsorption, or electrochemical dissolution. New materials are needed as the best catalysts for this reaction are based on Pt or Pt-group metals which are scarce and expensive. Similar problems exist at the anode; earth-abundant and catalytically active materials are needed for the oxidation of fuels such as hydrogen and methanol with the constraint that they must also be tolerant to possible catalyst poisons such as carbon monoxide or CHx species, which are ubiquitous in fuel feeds, or could even exist as reaction intermediates.</p>To view Jaramillo\u0092s full Research Statement, Current Students and Researchers list, see his <a href=\"http://chemenew.stanford.edu/faculty/profiles/jaramillo/jaramillo.html\">department page</a>.</p>", "keywords": [], "lab_website": "http://soe.stanford.edu/research/layout.php?sunetid=jaramilo", "department": "Chemical Engineering"},

Recent accomplishments include methods for heterologous production of polyketides; genetically reprogrammed biosynthesis of anthraquinones and polypropionates; and chemo-biosynthesis of new polyketides not readily affordable by synthetic or biological methods alone. These methodologies are already finding practical use. At the same time, we have placed a major emphasis on the biochemistry and structural biology of these giant protein assemblies. Fundamental insights into assembly line biosynthetic mechanisms have emerged, including the finding that protein-protein interactions play a central role in intermodular communications. In turn, these insights are highlighting opportunities for enhancing the efficiency of biosynthetic engineering. Over the next decade we envision that the predictive power of polyketide biosynthetic engineering will mature analogous to current protein engineering capabilities.More recently, we have investigated the pathogenesis of Celiac Sprue, an HLA-DQ2 associated inflammatory disease of the small intestine that is induced by exposure to gluten from foodgrains such as wheat, rye and barley. Within the past few years, we have explored three potential therapeutic strategies for this widespread but overlooked disease. By dissecting the unique chemical features of gluten, we discovered an intimate link between proteolytic stability and immunotoxicity of gluten, and translated this knowledge into the design of an oral enzyme therapy for the disease. We have also synthesized and evaluated mechanism-based inhibitors of human transglutaminase 2, the predominant disease associated auto-antigen, and used them to deduce the high-resolution structure of the antigen-bound protein. Finally, our structural and mechanistic dissection of HLA-DQ2 has been used to design, synthesize and evaluate gluten peptide analogues that selectively inhibit disease associated T cells. We remain committed to the vision that, within the next decade, safe and effective drugs will start having measurable impact on the health of celiac sprue patients.", "department": "Chemical Engineering", "lab_website": "http://soe.stanford.edu/research/layout.php?sunetid=khosla", "keywords": ["biocatalysis"]},

We are mounting a two-pronged attack on this problem using both molecular dynamics simulation and molecular modeling.(i) Simulation attempts to reproduce the structural, thermodynamic and dynamic properties of a macromolecule in as accurate a way as possible. Starting with simple but realistic expressions for the interactions between atoms and classical laws of motion, we calculate a trajectory that specifies the position and velocity of every atom as a function of time. The time-step between calculated structures is small at 10-15 seconds, and we need to reduce hundreds of thousands of sets of atomic coordinates into a simple coherent description. We have simulated with reasonable fidelity the measurable static and dynamic properties of the several different proteins surrounded by thousands of water molecules. Simulation at different temperatures has allowed exploration of the pathways of protein denaturation of entire proteins and small fragments of protein secondary structure (a-helices and \u00df-hairpins). Companion studies of DNA double-helix segments in solution preserve the classical double helix while still showing a wide repertoire of interesting motions. (ii) Molecular modeling attempts to build a model of a macromolecule using known three-dimensional structures and energy minimization as complementary guidelines. Specific examples of this work include the automatic modeling of antibody variable domains, the general modeling of homologous proteins and studies of DNA base-pair mismatches.

At the same time, most theoretical models describe the behavior of a single molecule interacting with its surroundings, and ensemble averaging over the number of molecules N is normally required to compute an observable. To explore what happens when ensemble averaging is removed, we use single-molecule optical spectroscopy, a set of ultrasensitive far-field and near-field laser techniques that allow us to detect and probe the detailed properties of individual molecules (N=1). In this way we can explore truly local behavior inside a solid, a liquid, or in a biomolecular system such as a protein in vitro or most recently, even a protein structure in a cell. Why is this new regime of single-molecule nanoscience fascinating? Complex systems such as condensed matter or biomolecules can contain hidden heterogeneity produced by different local environments, different conformational states, or even different protein folds. Single-molecule studies allow us to explore hidden heterogeneity because we measure the distribution of behavior by recording the properties of each member of the ensemble, one by one. There are several specific ways single molecule measurements can provide new information. Photochemistry or other photophysical changes in the immediate local environment can be detected as changes in resonant frequency or emission spectrum of the single molecule (spectral diffusion). We also obtain kinetic information from the detailed time dependence of the photon emission, or from the polarization changes that occur when the fluorophore rotates, or from the physical motion of the single-molecule label due to diffusion or other effects. By measuring energy transfer between two different fluorophores, distance information on the 5-9 nm scale can be obtained. Within the cell, many functional changes take place as a result of the action of a small number of copies of a protein or oligonucleotide, thus extreme sensitivity is required to understand how the system works. In collaboration with the molecular biology and biochemistry communities, we hope to discover how much can be learned with such single-molecule biophysical measurements. Recent studies have explored various genetically encoded fluorescent proteins like GFP, kinesin molecular motors, Ca++ ion concentration sensors, transmembrane proteins of the immune system in living cells, and genetic regulatory proteins in bacteria. Single fluorophores are also being used to explore local polymer dynamics in entangled systems. Single molecules also provide window into a growing new field, nanophotonics. We have used a single molecule to make a quantum mechanical (non-Poissonian) light source operating at room temperature. From another point of view, a single molecule can be viewed as a probe of its immediate local nanoenvironment on the scale on the order of the molecular size (~1 nm). At the same time, nanoscale electromagnetic structures can themselves perturb or enhance the molecular emission. In the future, a single molecule might be used as a readout element for a molecular scale device.", "department": "Chemistry", "lab_website": "http://soe.stanford.edu/research/layout.php?sunetid=moerner", "keywords": ["chemistry", "photonics"]},

Since its birth in 1956, the AI dream has been to build systems that exhibit \"broad spectrum\" intelligence.  However, AI has since splintered intomany different subfields, such as machine learning, vision, navigation, reasoning, planning, and natural language processing.  To realize its vision of a home assistant robot, STAIR will unify into a single platform tools drawn from all of these AI subfields. This is in distinct contrast to the 30-year-old trend of working on fragmented AI sub-fields, so that STAIR is also a unique vehicle for driving forward research towards true, integrated AI.Ng also works on machine learning algorithms for robotic control, in which rather than relying on months of human hand-engineering to design a controller, a robot instead learns automatically how best to control itself.  Using this approach, Ng's group has developed by far the most advanced autonomous helicopter controller, that is capable of flying spectacular aerobatic maneuvers that even experienced human pilots often find extremely difficult to execute.  As part of this work, Ng's group also developed algorithms that can take a single image,and turn the picture into a 3-D model that one can fly-through and see from different angles.", "department": "Computer Science", "lab_website": "http://soe.stanford.edu/research/layout.php?sunetid=ayn", "keywords": ["machine learning", "artificial intelligence.  emphasis on applications to robotic control", "and to natural language understanding"]},

Schnitzer has longstanding interests in neural circuit dynamics and optical imaging, and his laboratory has two major research efforts that are mutually complementary: In vivo two-photon fluorescence imaging studies of cerebellar-dependent learning and memory. Classical or Pavlovian conditioning is one of the simplest and earliest known forms of associative memory. A modern version of such conditioning that is suitable for use in mice and that depends critically on cerebellar function is classical eyeblink conditioning, in which a subject is trained to blink in response to a conditioning stimulus such as an audible tone. Many theories of how this cerebellar-dependent form of learning occurs focus on cerebellar Purkinje neurons, which exhibit highly regular anatomical patterns of neural connections. The Schnitzer lab has shown that they can image up to ~50 Purkinje cells simultaneously in live mice using in vivo two-photon fluorescence imaging. By combining in vivo imaging and electrophysiological techniques with behavioral and computational approaches, the lab seeks to understand the neural circuit dynamics in the cerebellar cortex that underlie learning, memory, and forgetting. Fiber optic fluorescence microendoscopy. The Schnitzer group has recently invented two forms of fiber optic fluorescence imaging, respectively termed one- and two-photon fluorescence microendoscopy, that enable minimally invasive in vivo imaging of cells within deep (brain) tissues with micron-scale resolution. For example, the group has been able to obtain video-rate movies of red blood cell flow within the rat hippocampus and thalamus, and to visualize hippocampal neurons and dendrites within live mice. The Schnitzer group now seeks to develop and apply microendoscopy to applications in both basic neurobiology and clinical settings.

An example of such a task in the medical domain is managing patients who are being treated with clinical guidelines. An inherent requirement of such tasks is to accumulate and to analyze patient data over time and constantly to revise an assessment of the patient's state by abstracting higher-level, context-sensitive concepts from the raw input data. These higher-level concepts can be used for summarizing large medical databases, for monitoring, for replanning therapy, for providing explanations to a user of a decision-support system, and as a basis for a more intelligent dialog between an automated decision-support system and a human health-care provider. My work focuses on defining basic knowledge-based, domain-independent temporal-abstraction mechanisms and the formal knowledge needed to instantiate them in any particular medical domain. Formalization of temporal-abstraction knowledge supports the acquisition, representation, maintenance, reuse, and sharing of that knowledge. I have therefore defined a knowlede-based temporal-abstraction framework, implemented it as the R\u00c9SUM\u00c9 system, and tested it in several clinical domains. The framework is currently being expanded, on one hand, and embedded in a larger architecture, Tzolkin, that will combine temporal-reasoning and temporal-maintenance services. Tzolkin is used within the EON component-based architecure for guideline-based care. I am also leading the KNAVE (knowledge-based Navigation of Abstractions for Visualization and Explanation) project, which focuses on an interactive framework for visualization and exploration of time-oriented data (e.g., patient clinical data) and their multiple-levels of abstractions. I also am interested in (therapy) plan generation, revision, recognition and critiquing in clinical domains; I am leading the Asgaard project, which investigates these tasks.

Our approach makes use of a range of theoretical and computational methods in statistical mechanics and polymer physics, including analytical theory of semiflexible polymers, polymer field theory, Brownian dynamics simulation, and Monte Carlo simulation. We focus on several experimental systems that are of scientific and technological importance, addressing the physical phenomena that underlie the observed behavior. For example, we study the physical manipulation of DNA in single-molecule experiments and in the packaging of an organism\u0092s genome. This theoretical effort aims to understand the exquisite control that Nature has over the DNA molecule and how we can mimic such methods in technological applications.</p>Single-molecule Biophysics</strong><br />Single-molecule manipulation plays an important role in our understanding of a wide range of biological processes. Experimental techniques for physically manipulating individual molecules have progressed in resolution to the point where processes that occur on the length scale of a couple of Angstroms can be detected, thus making it possible to directly observe a number of biological phenomena in situ. At this minute length scale, thermal fluctuations play a pivotal role in the physical behavior of these systems and act to compromise the resolution of the experimental measurement. Our theoretical work aims to predict the behavior in single-molecule experiments, providing a robust method to interpret their results and to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. We develop a theoretical framework for predicting the behavior of tethered-bead single-molecule experiments. Using our exact results for the statistical behavior of the molecular tether as a semiflexible polymer, we provide a formalism that is both accurate and easily implemented into experiments. This framework provides the flexibility to address a wide range of outstanding physical issues that play an important role in single-molecule biophysics.</p>DNA Packaging in Chromatin</strong><br />Our genome contains roughly a billion base pairs and is approximately 1 meter in length. This DNA strand must be packaged within a nucleus that is about 1 micron across while remaining accessible to the nuclear environment for protein expression. This engineering feat is accomplished by histone proteins that wrap the DNA into a hierarchical structure called chromatin. The first level in this hierarchical assembly is the nucleosome core particle, which consists of 146 base pairs of DNA wrapped around a histone protein complex. We build a model of the nucleosome core particle for comparison with single-molecule experiments in order to assign quantitative values to the adhesion strengths that lead to nucleosome formation. In so doing, we predict the forces that must be overcome to gain access to the packaged genomic code, lending insight into how to condense DNA and maintain accessibility in gene therapy applications. Our long term goal is to systematically address the assembly of chromatin starting from the nucleosomal level and leading to the hierarchical structure of the chromatin fiber.</p>Viral Packaging of DNA</strong><br />We address the internal structure of the DNA strand in order to predict the forces required to package the viral genome and to understand the degree of order necessary for the subsequent ejection of the packaged DNA. Future work will focus on the packaging of single-stranded DNA into Adeno-associated virus in order to optimize packaging for a viral-based gene therapy application.</p>", "department": "Chemical Engineering", "lab_website": "http://soe.stanford.edu/research/layout.php?sunetid=ajspakow ", "keywords": ["theory of biological systems", "complex fluids"]},

Biofilms play critical roles in water clean-up and bioremediation processes but are also of concern in medical implant-associated and oral diseases. The fundamental mechanism(s) how microbes adhere to a surface and how to excise and detach from a biofilm are largely unknown. In a combined genetic and physiological approach we investigate the molecular machinery that controls biofilm stability. This includes elucidating the actual molecular mechanism of how cells stick to a biofilm, as well as the regulation of such machinery. Results from these studies have implications of how to control biofilm-related diseases and environmental processes.</p>2) Cellular level of c-di-GMP signaling</strong><br />We discovered in our biofilm research that the stability of biofilms is controlled by a novel intracellular second messenger molecule, cyclic-di-GMP. Besides affecting biofilm formation, other aspects of microbial physiology such as motility, virulence, and also metabolic processes, are controlled by c-di-GMP in response to environmental signals. c-di-GMP may function on the allosteric but also on a transcriptional level. Moreover, analyzes of microbial genomes revealed the presence of dozens of diguanylate cyclase, catalyzing the synthesis of c-di-GMP from 2 GTP, as well as c-di-GMP hydrolyzing phosphodiesterases in genomes of microbes that exist in fluctuating environments. We seek to understand the molecular basis of c-di-GMP signaling (sensing the environment, signal transduction, control of activity of effector molecules), as well as the molecular logic of signal integration using a genome level approach. In a combination of genetic, biochemical, and physiological approaches, we are dissecting the circuitry of c-di-GMP signaling in Shewanella oneidensis and Vibrio cholerae.</p>3) Molecular evolution of new genetic traits in microbes</strong><br />We have found that genetic variants rapidly arise in biofilm environments, thereby, contributing to the functional diversification in such environments. However, the molecular causes and consequences of such rapid evolution are unclear. Making use of the power of microbial evolution (rapid generation time and large population size), we are conducting studies on the molecular evolution of new genetic traits in response to specific selective pressures. In an extension of this approach, we are also pursuing the experimental evolution of microbial interactions, specifically the evolution of mutualism. We also explore how experimental evolution can be used as a molecular engineering tool to evolve industrially useful properties in microbes.</p>4) Microbial reductive dehalogenation</strong><br />Chloroethenes, such as PCE and TCE, are the most prevalent groundwater contaminants in the U.S. and the developed countries. Large scale remediation of contaminated aquifers relies largely on the activity of a group of unusual microbes (Dehalococcoides sp.) that derive energy from reductive dehalogenation, thereby, using the chlorinated </p>", "department": "Chemical Engineering", "lab_website": "http://soe.stanford.edu/research/layout.php?sunetid=quacks", "keywords": ["microbial biofilms", "microbial interactions", "bacterial biochemistry", "genomics", "molecular evolution and population biology", "molecular hydrogen production in photosynthetic bacteria"]},

The power and versatility of cell-free methods coupled with careful evaluation and engineering of these new systems enables a whole new range of applications and scientific investigation. Fundamental research on: the mechanisms and kinetics of ribosomal function, fundamental bioenergetics, basic mechanisms of protein folding, functional genomics, and metabolic pathway analysis is motivated by a variety of near- and medium term applications spanning medicine, energy, and environmental needs.Swartz Lab Application Foci</b>In the medical area , current research addresses the need for patient-specific vaccines to treat cancer. Particularly for lymphomas, there is a strong need to be able to make a new cancer vaccine for each patient. Current technologies are not practical for this demanding task, but cell-free approaches are rapid and inexpensive. We have already demonstrated feasibility in mouse tumor challenge studies and are now expanding the range of applications and working to improve the relevant technologies. Experience with these vaccines has also suggested a new and exciting format for making inexpensive and very potent vaccines for general use.To address pressing needs for a new and cleaner energy source, we are working towards an organism that can efficiently capture solar energy and convert it into hydrogen. The first task is to develop an oxygen tolerant hydrogenase using cell-free technology to express libraries of mutated enzymes that can be rapidly screened for improved function. Even though these are very complex enzymes, we have produced active hydrogenases with our cell-free methods. We are now perfecting the screening methods for rapid and accurate identification of improved enzymes. After these new enzymes are identified, the project will progress toward metabolic engineering and bioreactor design research to achieve the scales and economies required.To address environmental needs, we are developing an improved water filters using an amazing membrane protein, Aquaporin Z. It has the ability to reject all other chemicals and ions except water. We have efficiently expressed the protein into lipid bilayer vesicles and are now working to cast these membranes on porous supports to complete the development of a new and powerful water purification technology.

A particular focus is the development of organometallic and organic catalysts for the synthesis of complex macromolecular architectures. In organometallic catalysis, we investigate catalysts that can access multiple kinetic states during a polymerization reaction in order to control sequence distribution. We have devised a novel strategy for the synthesis of elastomeric polypropylene utilizing a metallocene catalyst whose structure was designed to interconvert between chiral and achiral coordination geometries on the timescale of the synthesis of a single polymer chain. We have also developed a novel method for the synthesis of alternating copolymers of ethylene and propylene by exploiting catalysts that can access multiple coordination sites that exhibit different kinetic selectivities towards the two monomers. In collaboration with Jim Hedrick of IBM laboratories, we have developed an extensive platform of organic catalysts for the controlled ring-opening polymerization of lactones. Mechanistic studies of nucleophilic N-heterocyclic carbene catalysts revealed an unusual zwitterionic mechanism which enabled the synthesis of high molecular weight cyclic polyesters, a novel topology for these biodegradable and biocompatible macromolecules. These efforts combine elements of mechanistic organic and organometallic chemistry, polymer synthesis, and homogeneous catalysis to rationally design new macromolecular structures.", "department": "Chemistry", "lab_website": "http://soe.stanford.edu/research/layout.php?sunetid=waymouth", "keywords": ["catalysis", "inorganic", "organometallic", "and polymer chemistry"]},
