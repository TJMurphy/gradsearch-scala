    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
        If you've ever tried to find graduate schools you may have found it to be an infuriating experience.
        Existing search engines are focused around finding a particular school.  This makes sense for an
        undergraduate education, but for graduate school it's all wrong.  You aren't looking for a school &#8212;
        you're looking for a professor. Re:search solves that problem.  Enter your research interests, broad
        or specific, and browse through professors from dozens of universities who are studying what you're
        studying.
    </p>
    <p>
        To use Re:search, enter a research interest, department, university, or professor's name into the search bar.
        Re:search will display professors who match your query. Click on a professor to see their full profile,
        including a research summary, awards, and publications. If you register for the site, you can bookmark
        professors and save searches to view later.
