Laser-based spectroscopic sensor systems have an excellent potential to address all those needs and provide noninvasive, rapid chemical analysis of the sample of interest both remotely or in-situ.

Therefore, one of my research directions is focused on development of widely tunable mid-infrared external cavity quantum cascade lasers (EC-QCLs) for high-resolution spectroscopic applications in chemical analysis. This technology enables new applications that represent a significant challenge for spectroscopists with existing laser sources (i.e., detection of complex molecules with broadband unresolved ro-vibrational absorption bands, simultaneous detection of multiple molecular species, and spectroscopy of liquid/solid samples). EC-QCLs with tuning ranges up to 15% of the center wavelength and output powers up to 50mW were recently demonstrated in various spectroscopic applications, such as photoacoustic detection of broadband absorbers and high-resolution (&lt; 0.001 cm-1) Faraday rotation spectroscopy of nitric oxide. In the case of single-sampling-point trace-gas monitoring, lack of spatial information makes it impossible to localize specific emission sources (e.g., accidental gas leaks or unauthorized industrial emissions). The deployment of a sensor network will enable continuous spatial trace-gas monitoring of a large geographical area, providing complete static (concentration) and dynamic (fluxes, sources, and sinks) information about target analytes. In one of our current research projects we are developing a low-power, miniature spectroscopic trace-gas sensor for wirelessly communicating distributed sensor networks. Off particular interest in this research effort are ultra-sensitive spectroscopic techniques, application of novel optoelectronic devices, power-efficient electronics for data acquisition and signal processing, and integration at both the device and the system level.</p>\n", "department": "Electrical Engineering", "keywords": ["Applied Physics", "Photonics"]},

The continual scaling of VLSI devices to smaller dimensions, higher performance, and higher integration levels over the last thirty years has directly enabled the \"information society.\" Scaling has reduced the cost of intelligence (that is, electronic circuits) by some six orders of magnitude, while performance has continuously increased. Continued growth of the information economy depends on the further scaling of silicon-based electronic devices to the 0.1 micron (nanoscale) level and beyond. Our group works to achieve this goal through the science and technology of silicon-based heterojunctions and three-dimensional integration for VLSI. The work involves the growth of novel materials on a near-atomic scale, materials processing, and finally their application into electronic devices such as heterojunction transistors, FET's, quantum devices, and also optoelectronic devices such as infrared detectors and emitters. Specific focuses in our lab include rapid thermal chemical vapor deposition, silicon-germanium and silicon-germanium-carbon alloys, silicon-on-insulator, and heterojunction devices.</p>\n<p>On the other extreme, many electronic information processing systems as a whole are limited on both a fundamental and practical economic level by the human-machine interface. For example, the ability to deliver high-quality video is often limited by the display.

Because low cost over a large area is a requirement for widespread impact in the future in this field, materials and technologies very different from VLSI are necessary. For example, polycrystalline and amorphous materials, instead of single crystals, and low-cost alternatives to conventional photolithography and etching are highly desirable. To this end, our lab focuses on organic and polymeric semiconductors because of their ease of deposition over large areas (and applications to organic LED's and FET's) as well as on amorphous and polycrystalline silicon for TFT's.

It is critical to consider, for instance, how to deploy in concert an ever-increasing number of transistors with acceptable power consumption, and how to make hardware user-friendly yet effective for applications. Over the past 30 years, my research group has studied the development of signal processing systems. Our research findings have played direct and indirect roles in the construction of a number of useful signal processing systems. In this dynamic discipline, however, emerging applications always dictate new system metrics on power consumption, speed, and performance. This inspires novel intellectual challenges on system designs. Two vital applications that have emerged in recent years are multimedia and genomics. They form an important basis of a new paradigm of information processing that relies heavily on intelligent search/processing.</p>\n<p>Multimedia technologies will profoundly change the way we access information. They will also provide new challenges for machine learning research. We investigate various issues relevant to intelligent multimedia communication application, and develop machine learning tools for various adaptive and content-based technologies for MPEG-4 applications such as compression, indexing, and retrieval of visual information. This work has natural and promising extensions to internet search engines, document analysis, and biometric authentication.</p>\n<p>The field of bioinformatics represents a natural convergence of life sciences and information technologies. Modern large-scale DNA devices such as microarrays have rapidly and steadily generated enormous amounts of genomic data. We study advanced machine learning tools that could reveal salient information embedded in genomic data and facilitate classification and prediction of tumors and their responses to drug therapies.</p>\n<p>From the application perspective, machine learning is both effective and instrumental for distilling useful information embedded in the wealth of the available data. We study tailor-designed machine learning tools for specific applications including feature extraction, clustering, and classification. Machine learning tools can also be adopted to facilitate integration of data collected from experiments in different levels of biological systems or fusion of diversified multimedia data such as text, speech, image, video, and graphics.</p>\n<p>In addition to application studies, we also investigate theoretical aspects of machine learning, based on the basic principle of learning by example. These theoretical foundations include statistical learning, optimization, and algebraic theory. In the past half century, machine learning techniques have evolved from simple linear classifiers to neural networks and, recently, to kernel-based approaches. The promise of the kernel approach hinges upon its new representation vector space, leading to a divergent data structure. It also theoretically assures the linear separability of training data in the reproducible kernel space. Moreover, it provides a unified treatment of heterogeneous genomic data, including vectors, sequences, and graphs.</p>\n<p>We investigate both categories of kernel-based learning techniques:</p>\n<p>1. Unsupervised learning for cluster discovery and graph partition. Kernel approaches extend the conventional K-means (designed for clustering vectors in Euclidean space) to any objects that can be characterized by pairwise relationship (sequences or graphs).    The result may be applied to kernel-based (e.g., kernel K-means), and graph-based clustering algorithms. The latter have potential applications to genomics (e.g., interaction networks, metabolic networks, or signaling pathways) and multimedia (e.g., search engines and World Wide Web/social networks).</p>\n<p>2. Supervised cluster discovery and supervised classification/prediction. Kernel approaches provide a unified framework between Fisher and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. This ultimately leads to a unifying hybrid classifier, which includes Fisher\u2019s discriminant analysis (FDA) and SVM as special cases. The unified classifier offers necessary flexibility for improving prediction performance.</p>\n", "department": "Electrical Engineering", "keywords": ["Computing & Networking", "Information Sciences & Systems"]},

The scaling of bulk CMOS, however, faces significant challenges in the future due to fundamental material and process technology limits. The primary obstacles to the scaling of bulk CMOS to the 22nm technology node include short-channel effects, sub-threshold leakage, and device-to-device variations. It is expected that the use of double-gate field-effect transistors (DG-FETs), the most popular of which are FinFETs, will be necessary to overcome these obstacles to scaling. My group is actively investigating novel FinFET-based circuits, memories, and computer architectures. 3D ICs are emerging as solutions to the problems of long interconnect and memory bandwidth. In addition, such ICs enable \u201cMore than Moore's Law\u201d applications that allow heterogeneous integration across their multiple layers, opening up exciting possibilities for innovative SoC design. We are investigating various 3D ICs that employ novel system designs comprising embedded processors, RF circuitry, FPGAs, and memories. Power consumption has become one of the most important metrics in evaluating a circuit today. This is due both to environmental considerations and to a variety of technical requirements such as prolonging battery life in portable devices, reducing chip packaging and cooling costs, and increasing reliability. To that end, my group has been researching low-power FPGAs, interconnection networks, and CMPs. We are also interested in the related important problem of dynamic thermal management. Security is emerging as an important concern in the embedded system area. Security of embedded systems is often compromised due to vulnerabilities in the \u201ctrusted\u201d software they execute. Security attacks exploit these vulnerabilities. My group has been working on a hardware-assisted paradigm as well as virtualization to enhance embedded system security by detecting and preventing the execution of malware. If not enough care is taken when testing an IC, even a good die may be inadvertently damaged by the high temperatures caused by test application. Although low-power test has a rich history, temperature-aware test is a new field. We are currently developing various temperature-aware test methodologies. The quest for quantum computers is gathering steam. Various quantum algorithms have been developed that show speeds orders of magnitude above those of classical computing. My group is interested in automatically obtaining optimized quantum logic circuits from these quantum algorithms. Energy consumption has also become an important issue, especially from the point of view of carbon dioxide emissions. In the U.S., buildings consume 40% of the total energy. Thus, reducing the energy consumed in buildings can have a substantial national impact. My group is developing various types of sensors to reduce the electricity/heating costs in buildings.

{"school": "Princeton", "name": "Andrew Houck", "image": "http://ee.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/aahouck.png", "research_summary": "<p>Quantum mechanics has played an ever-increasing role in electronics over the past several decades. At first, materials and devices were introduced that were designed with quantum mechanical principles, but still operated on classical information (for example, the silicon transistor). More recently, devices have been developed to store and manipulate quantum bits of information (qubits) towards quantum computing applications. Until the past few years, however, these qubits have only been addressed with classical light signals. A fully quantum mechanical circuit, in which quantum mechanical microwave signals address quantum bits, enables scalable quantum computing architectures and makes possible a full range of quantum optics experiments, all on a single chip in an integrated circuit. Our research focuses on these fully quantum mechanical integrated circuits, combining basic quantum mechanics, superconducting electronics, microwave circuits, quantum optics, and low-temperature measurement. The backbone of our work is a system known as circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED). This system consists of a superconducting qubit coupled to an on-chip microwave resonator; the qubit can absorb and re-emit a single photon into the cavity hundreds of times before the photon is lost. This strong coupling opens the door to a vast array of experiments in quantum computing and non-linear optics. These are the two main thrusts of my research. First, my group is looking at ways of building a robust scalable quantum architecture. While small qubit systems have been developed and microwave cavities have been shown to make a good quantum bus connecting these qubits, large-scale quantum computers remain a distant goal. Quantum information is quite fragile, and individual qubits are currently plagued by information loss, called decoherence. Are there ways of building individual qubits that are robust to dominant noise sources? Even if perfect qubits could be achieved, new problems arise as circuits get more and more complicated. How can we wire up complex systems without destroying the individual parts? These are the types of quantum computing questions we address experimentally. My second main research area is the study of quantum and non-linear optics. Although people tend to think of lasers when they hear the term \u201coptics,\u201d the oscillating voltages and currents in a microwave circuit are also photons, and all principles of quantum optics apply to these devices as well. In fact, non-linearities can be much stronger in microwave devices, allowing us access to a very interesting regime of quantum optics. The goal of this area of research is to address the central question: What happens when a system is non-linear at powers where quantization is important?</p>\n", "department": "Electrical Engineering", "keywords": ["Applied Physics", "Photonics"]},

Our special focus is currently on Quantum Cascade (QC) lasers, a novel type of semiconductor injection laser based on electronic intersubband transitions in the conduction band of a coupled quantum well heterostructure. Quantum wells are slivers of one type of semiconductor material, just a few atomic layers thick, interleaved with another type of semiconductor (the barriers). Many performance features of the lasers, such as their power, modulation capabilities, or emission wavelength in the mid- to far-infrared, are designed into the device by choice of the thicknesses of the quantum wells and barriers. With some 500 to 1000 quantum wells and barriers in a single laser, there are endless opportunities for creativity! Our current projects include the development of high-temperature, high-power, high-efficiency QC lasers. Widely tunable, monolithic, and external cavity QC lasers are being developed for optical sensors in environmental, medical, and security applications. While my group is focused mainly on the development of the lasers, we maintain strong collaborations with many expert spectroscopists who are building sensor systems in academia, government, and industrial labs.

Fleischer", "image": "http://ee.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/jason.png", "research_summary": "<p>My research focuses on nonlinear optics within the broader context of general wave physics. The emphasis is on propagation problems that are universal to wave systems, taking advantage of the fact that optical systems allow easy control of the input and direct imaging of the output. Using a healthy mix of theory and experiment, my group studies both basic nonlinear physics and advanced design issues for photonic applications. As a prime example, my group is developing optical hydrodynamics, in which the nonlinear propagation of light is described in terms of the equations for ideal fluid flow. For coherent (laser) light, the intensity acts as a fluid density while the direction of the wavefront gives an effective velocity. For incoherent light, the propagation can be treated as a statistical fluid, i.e. a plasma. Using these mappings, we have experimentally demonstrated optical shock waves, instabilities, turbulence, and thermodynamics. There are two primary results of these mappings: (1) optical modeling and observation of fluid behavior that is difficult, if not impossible, to see by other means and (2) a framework for the discovery of new optical physics. If the optical waves carry information, then propagation can be leveraged for dynamical signal processing. For example, nonlinear wave mixing can result in (intensity-dependent) energy transfer between modes, enabling higher resolution, increase field of view, and improved signal-noise properties. Recently, we have generalized computational imaging to include spatial nonlinearity and are applying it to microscopy, phase retrieval, and imaging through scattering media.
