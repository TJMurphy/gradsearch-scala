Guth", "image": "http://web.mit.edu/Physics/images/faculty/guth_alan.jpg", "research_summary": "\r\n<p>Most of Professor Guth's research has centered on the application of theoretical particle physics to the early universe: what can particle physics tell us about the history of the universe, and what can cosmology tell us about the fundamental laws of nature? In 1981 he proposed that many features of our universe, including how it came to be so uniform and why it began so close to the critical density, can be explained by a new cosmological model which he called <strong>inflation</strong>. Inflation is a modification of the conventional big bang theory, proposing that the expansion of the universe was propelled by a repulsive gravitational force generated by an exotic form of matter. Although Guth's initial proposal was flawed (as he pointed out in his original paper), the flaw was soon overcome by the invention of \"new inflation,\" by <a href=\"http://www.stanford.edu/~alinde/\" target=\"_blank\">Andrei Linde</a> in the Soviet Union and independently by <a href=\"http://www.physics.ucdavis.edu/Cosmology/albrecht/\" target=\"_blank\">Andreas Albrecht</a> and <a href=\"http://www.physics.princeton.edu/~steinh/\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Steinhardt</a> in the US. After more than 20 years of development and scrutiny the evidence for the inflationary universe model now looks better than ever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the intriguing consequences of inflation is that quantum fluctuations in the early universe can be stretched to astronomical proportions, providing the seeds for the large scale structure of the universe. The predicted spectrum of these fluctuations was calculated by Guth and others in 1982. These fluctuations can be seen today as ripples in the cosmic background radiation, but the amplitude of these faint ripples is only about one part in 100,000. Nonetheless, these ripples were detected by the COBE satellite in 1992, and they have now been measured to much higher precision by the <a href=\"http://wmap.gsfc.nasa.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">WMAP satellite</a> and other experiments. The properties of the radiation are found to be in excellent agreement with the predictions of the simplest models of inflation [<a href=\"http://wmap.gsfc.nasa.gov/m_ig/030634/030634_s.gif\" target=\"_blank\">image</a>].</p>\r\n<p>Working with Prof. <a href=\"farhi_edward.html\">Edward Farhi</a> and others, Guth has explored the question of whether it is in principle possible to ignite inflation in a hypothetical laboratory, thereby creating a new universe. The answer is a definite maybe. They showed that it cannot be done classically, but with quantum tunneling it might be theoretically possible. The new universe, if it can be created, would not endanger our own universe. Instead it would slip through a wormhole and rapidly disconnect completely.</p>\r\n<p>Another intriguing feature of inflation is that almost all versions of inflation are eternal\u2014once inflation starts, it never stops completely. Inflation has ended in our part of the universe, but very far away one expects that inflation is continuing, and will continue forever. Is it possible, then, that inflation is also eternal into the past? Recently Guth has worked with <a href=\"http://cosmos2.phy.tufts.edu/vilenkin.html\" target=\"_blank\">Alex Vilenkin</a> (Tufts) and Arvind Borde (Southampton College) to show that the inflating region of spacetime must have a past boundary, and that some new physics, perhaps a quantum theory of creation, would be needed to understand it.</p>\r\n<p>Much of Guth's current work also concerns the study of density fluctuations arising from inflation: What are the implications of novel forms of inflation? Can the underlying theory be made more rigorous? Guth is also interested in pursuing the possibility of inflation in \"brane world\" models, which propose that our universe is a 3+1\u2013dimensional membrane floating in a higher dimensional space.</p>\r\n<p>Guth's earlier work has included the study of lattice gauge theory, magnetic monopoles and instantons, Gott time machines, and a number of other topics in theoretical physics.</p>\r\n\r\n", "department": "Physics", "keywords": ["Cosmology: Theory, \r\nParticle Cosmology"]},

Theory  predicts that in principle changes in the fluctuations of the population size  can be used to anticipate an impending \u201ctipping point\u201d leading to population  collapse. Our group has used laboratory yeast populations to experimentally measure  these theoretically predicted early warning indicators based on critical  slowing down (Dai et al, <em>Science</em> (2012)). More recently, the group demonstrated that there is a spatial analogue  to the standard time-based indicator. Isolated populations near a tipping point  experience an increase in \u201crecovery time\u201d following a perturbation, whereas  spatially extended populations near a tipping point experience an increase in a  \u201crecovery length\u201d near a boundary between regions of different quality (Dai et  al, Nature (2013)). The laboratory is now exploring how these early warning  indicators behave in more complicated situations, including populations with  genetic heterogeneity and in multi-species ecosystems. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Evolution  of cooperation \u2013</strong> The conditions required for the  initiation and maintenance of cooperative behaviors is a classic problem in  evolutionary biology. How can cooperators survive when they can be taken  advantage of by \"cheaters\"? \u00a0As  a Pappalardo Postdoctoral Fellow here at MIT, Jeff used sucrose metabolism in  yeast as a model system to study the evolution of cooperation (Gore et al, <em>Nature</em> (2009)). The normal \u201ccooperative\u201d  cells secrete the enzyme that breaks down sucrose, whereas cells lacking the  gene encoding this enzyme act as cheaters because they do not contribute to  breaking down this shared resource. Jeff found that the cooperators can survive  even in the presence of cheaters because the cooperators capture a small  fraction (~1%) of the sugar they create before it is shared, thus making the  interaction what game theorists call a snowdrift game (as compared to the  standard model of cooperation known as the prisoner\u2019s dilemma, in which  cooperation goes extinct in these simple well-mixed conditions). The laboratory  has used this model system to demonstrate that both spatial expansion and  competition between species can favor cooperation (Datta et al, <em>PNAS </em>(2013); Celiker and Gore, <em>Molecular Systems Biology</em> (2013))). We  have also found that the evolutionary dynamics between cooperator and cheater  interact in a feedback loop with changes in the population size to determine  how populations respond to environmental deterioration (Sanchez and Gore, <em>PLOS Biology</em> (2013)). More recently, the  laboratory has explored the evolutionary consequences of the cooperative  inactivation of antibiotics by bacteria (Yurtsev et al, <em>Molecular Systems Biology </em>(2013); Artemova et al, <em>submitted</em> (2013)). </p>\r\n<p><strong>Rugged fitness landscapes and  the reversibility of evolution \u2013</strong> The fitness effect of a  mutation often depends upon the presence or absence of other mutations in the  genome. This genetic epistasis leads to \u201crugged fitness landscapes\u201d that may  constrain the path of evolution. Using a publicly available dataset of the  growth rate of millions of double gene knockouts in yeast, the group found a  surprisingly weak scaling of the epistatic interactions with the strength of  mutations (Velenich and Gore, <em>Genome  Biology</em> (2013)). The laboratory has also measured the fitness landscapes  corresponding to different versions of an antibiotic resistance gene in two  different antibiotics to explore the reversibility of evolution worked to  quantify the magnitude of these effects and has also used these ideas to explore  the reversibility of evolution in the context of molecular changes in an enzyme  (Tan et al, <em>Phys Rev Lett</em> (2012)). In  an intriguing parallel to thermodynamics, the lab has also found that slowly  switching between environments increases the reversibility of evolution for  small populations (Tan et al, <em>Evolution</em> (2012)).\r\n  \r\n</p>\r\n", "department": "Physics", "keywords": ["Biophysics"]},

For planetary nebulae formed in interacting binary systems, the                 wind of the asymptotic giant branch star may be shaped by either                 the binary companion or a possible collimated fast outflow from                 the companion. These are being studied with smooth particle hydrodynamic                 simulations. </p>\r\n<p>Such population synthesis calculations yield                 theoretical distributions of the properties of the systems of interest,                 including the masses of the compact object and its companion, the                 orbital period, and the mass transfer rate at the current epoch.                 By comparing the theoretical distributions to the observational                 results obtained by X-ray, optical, and radio astronomers, one can                 hope to learn about the validity of the various input parameters                 utilized in the calculations. For example, the assumptions about                 stellar birth rates, orbital period distribution, and mass ratios                 of primordial binaries can be tested. Moreover, the method of handling                 the common envelope phase of the binary evolution (likely involved                 in the production of most collapsed stars in binary systems), and                 the distribution of 'kick' velocities imparted to the neutron star                 during its birth in a supernova explosion, are also testable. </p>\r\n<p>The observational side of Prof. Rappaport's                 research emphasizes studies of X-ray pulsars.

His group is particularly interested in what implications the observational                 results have for binary star evolution. Recent work includes the                 first determination of the orbit of the neutron star in the well-known                 classical Be-star system X Per. The combination of the wide orbital                 separation (about 2 AU) and the small orbital eccentricity (0.11)                 has significant implications for the 'kick' velocities imparted                 to neutron stars at their birth. This discovery bolsters previous                 claims by some researchers that the natal kick distribution is bimodal,                 with a substantial fraction of neutron stars receiving at most a                 small kick.</p>\r\n", "department": "Physics", "keywords": ["Astrophysics: Compact Objects - Binary Evolution "]},

His research interests include the properties of the cold dense  quark matter that may lie at the centers of neutron stars, where the densities  are so high that the neutrons are crushed one upon another. Professor  Rajagopal's work shows that a lump of cold dense quark matter is the QCD  analogue of a superconductor but that if you were to look at it using ordinary  light, it would look like a transparent insulator and not like an electric  conductor as previously assumed. His work also shows that somewhat less dense  quark matter may be, in a certain sense, crystalline. Professor Rajagopal also  studies the properties of very hot quark matter, of the sort that filled the  universe shortly after the big bang and that is created in current experiments  at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. He is using\u00a0gauge/gravity  duality --- originally developed by string theorists seeking to understand  quantum gravity --- to understand properties of strongly coupled, liquid-like,  quark-gluon plasma. \u00a0For example, he analyzes how a high energy quark  plowing through this liquid loses energy and under what conditions a pair of  heavy quarks moving through this fluid can bind into a meson.  \u00a0Professor\u00a0Rajagopal has also analyzed the critical point in the QCD  phase diagram and has proposed signatures for its experimental detection,  making it possible for experimentalists at RHIC\u00a0to search for the critical  point in a large region of the phase diagram. </p>\r\n\r\n", "department": "Physics", "keywords": ["Theoretical Nuclear and Particle Physics"]},

Nevertheless, there are a number of\r\n  fundamental and seemingly simple questions we do not yet know the answer to. My present\r\n  research focuses on one of those fundamental question which is how particles acquire their\r\n  mass. We know very well that particles have masses, but have not yet been able to show experimentally through which mechanism it happens. Therefore, we will need to find a missing\r\n  particle, the Higgs boson, which we believe is responsible for the fact that all particles have\r\n  mass. The quest for the Higgs boson is presently my main research objective.</p>\r\n<p> In experimental particle physics we make use of Einstein\u2019s fundamental observation that\r\n  mass, <i>m</i>, and energy, <i>E</i>, can be converted into each other through a simple constant <i>c<sup>2</sup></i>:\r\n  <i>E = mc<sup>2</sup></i>. This means the higher the energy in the particle collision the higher the mass of\r\n  the particles we can produce. As a rule of thumb the particles we are looking for, like the\r\n  Higgs boson, are of high mass and thus the higher the energy the more discovery potential\r\n  the collision has. Another feature of particle collisions is that the higher the particle\u2019s mass\r\n  the rarer its production. Thus it is very important to have intense particle beams to increase\r\n  the number of collisions we can produce and analyze in a given amount of time. For my\r\n  research I am recording and analyzing data of high-energy proton-proton collisions at the\r\n  Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland. With the LHC the energy\r\n  and intensity frontiers make a quantum leap forward with the collision energy increasing by\r\n  a factor of seven while the intensity increases by two orders of magnitude with respect to the\r\n  most powerful existing machine, the Tevatron at Fermilab. There is no certainty of what is\r\n  going to happen, but I believe we are at the brink of something big as collisions at the LHC\r\n  are about to open a door to truly uncharted territory.</p>\r\n", "department": "Physics", "keywords": ["High Energy Physics"]},

Much like the early universe, our group has grown rapidly.</p>\r\n<p>My interest has centered on whether successful inflation might be achieved with familiar particles from the Standard Model of particle physics, such as the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2012/07/06/david-kaiser/higgs-at-last/\">Higgs boson</a>. Recent work has focused on predictions from models with several interacting fields, and whether multifield models produce new features that could be observed in the cosmic microwave background radiation, compared to single-field models. Much of this work has also concerned interactions between matter and gravity that extend beyond Einstein's general relativity, and whether such \"nonminimal couplings\" might account for specific observable features in the spectrum of primordial perturbations. For a brief and accessible introduction to this work, see \"<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kaiser/elegant-wiggles-how-the-u_b_1531848.html\">Elegant Wiggles: Why the Universe is Lumpy</a>.\"</p>\r\n<p>I have also studied how such inflationary expansion might have come to an end in a process called \"reheating,\" when the energy that had driven the rapid expansion was converted into particles more like the kind we see around us today. In many models, the decay of this inflationary energy occurs resonantly (somewhat akin to a laser, rather than an ordinary light bulb), far from equilibrium. In some cases these resonant interactions can amplify large gravitational fluctuations, which might (in principle) prove detectable in the cosmic microwave background radiation. Moreover, the techniques used to study the dynamics of reheating can also be applied to many other kinds of interactions, such as phase transitions in condensed-matter physics and in nuclear physics.

At present, he is investigating                 a promising new model for the origin of cosmic gamma-ray bursts,                 a mysterious phenomenon that has puzzled astrophysicists for the                 past thirty years. In this new model, two massive stars in a binary                 system merge to form a single, rapidly rotating star. The newly                 formed star later explodes to form an extraordinary type of supernova,                 which has been dubbed a \"hypernova.\" During the hypernova explosion,                 the core of the star collapses to form a central black hole, while                 the rapidly rotating matter just outside the core forms a massive                 torus surrounding the black hole. It then takes anywhere from a                 fraction of a second to a few minutes for the matter in the torus                 to fall into the black hole, releasing huge amounts of energy as                 it does so. This object can be called a microquasar, since it is                 a miniature version of the quasars that form in the nuclei of active                 galaxies. In both quasars and microquasars, the energy released                 by the infalling matter is emitted in beams that are directed along                 the rotation axis of the infalling matter. In the case of a microquasar                 produced in a hypernova event, we see a gamma-ray burst if one of                 these beams is directed toward the earth.

This work started in earnest with the initial observation (with Rao et al. at the University of Kentucky in 1997) of the Raman spectra from bundles of single wall carbon nanotubes and showing a strong enhancement of the spectra through a diameter selective resonance Raman effect. Next we showed characteristic differences between the Raman profile of the G-band depending on whether the nanotubes were metallic or semiconducting. This work eventually led to the observation of Raman spectra from one single nanotube, with intensities under good resonance conditions comparable to that from the silicon substrate, even though the ratio of carbon to silicon atoms in the light beam was approximately only one carbon atom to one hundred million silicon atoms. All Raman features normally observed in single wall nanotube (SWNT) bundles are also observed in spectra at the single nanotube level, including the radial breathing mode, the G-band, the D-band and the G'-band. However, at the single nanotube level, the characteristics of each feature can be studied in detail, including its dependence on diameter, chirality, laser excitation energy and closeness to resonance with electronic transitions. Of particular importance is the uniqueness of the electronic transition energies for each nanotube, which are described in terms of two integers (n, m) which uniquely specify the geometrical structure of the nanotube, including its diameter and chirality. The high sensitivity of the Raman spectra to diameter and chirality, particularly for the characteristics of the radial breathing mode, which are also uniquely related to the same (n, m) indices, thereby providing a structural determination of (n, m) at the single nanotube level. The (n, m) assignments made to individual carbon nanotubes are corroborated by measuring the characteristics of other features in the Raman spectra that are sensitive to nanotube diameter and chirality. Raman spectroscopy potentially provides a convenient way to characterize nanotubes for their (n, m) indices, in a manner that is compatible with the measurement of other nanotube properties, such as transport, mechanical and electronic properties at the single nanotube level, and the dependence of these properties on nanotube diameter and chirality. </p>\r\n<p>We have devised a way to prepare arrays of aligned bismuth nanowires down to 7 nm diameter (embedded in an anodic alumina template), 50-100 microns in length, with a wire density of ~ 1011/cm2, with their wire axes along a common crystalline orientation, and preserving the crystal structure of bulk bismuth. We previously predicted a semimetal-semiconductor transition in bismuth nanowires as a function of nanowire diameter due to quantum confinement effects, and we have now succeeded in observing this effect through transport measurements. We are now studying the transport and optical properties of the nanowire arrays with particular relevance to enhancing their thermoelectric properties. For scientific studies we are developing techniques to make measurements of the resistance of single quantum wires as a function of nanowire diameter using a 4-probe method. The doping of bismuth with antimony, which is isoelectronic to bismuth, is of special interest for achieving an enhancement in thermoelectric performance, especially for p-type legs in thermoelectric devices. For this reason we are now studying the structure, electronic and transport properties of bismuth-antimony nanowires as a function of nanowire diameter and antimony concentration.</p>\r\n", "department": "Physics", "keywords": ["Condensed Matter Experiment"]},

This became clear when neutrinos were shown to live  a double life,\r\ntransforming from one type into another through the  quantum mechanical\r\neffect of neutrino oscillations. This effect requires  neutrino mass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neutrino mass is the first \"chink\" in the  surprisingly resilient theory of\r\n  particle physics called The Standard Model. The purpose  of my research is to\r\n  exploit this opportunity through further study of  neutrinos. . First, now\r\n  that we know that neutrinos have surprising new  properties, I am involved in\r\n  tests to see if they have more unexpected  \"features\". Second, we must\r\n  develop a model for particle physics that incorporates  neutrino mass, and I\r\n  am contributing by searching for predicted but  as-yet-unseen oscillation\r\n  modes.</p>\r\n<p>My studies using neutrinos as probes for new physics  involve the BooNE\r\n  experiments. The first generation of these experiments  was the MiniBooNE\r\n  experiment, which searched for a new neutrino beyond the  three types known\r\n  in the Standard Model. This was motivated by an  oscillation result from the\r\n  Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector (LSND) experiment  at Los Alamos, which\r\n  indicated an oscillation wavelength inconsistent with  other experiments,\r\n  perhaps pointing to the existence of a fourth neutrino  species. MiniBooNE\r\n  provided a strict test of this hypothesis, and ruled out  the explanation of\r\n  a fourth type of neutrino. MiniBooNE continues to take  data at Fermi\r\n  National Accelerator Laboratory.</p>\r\n<p>However, while one neutrino anomaly has been resolved,  another has sprung\r\n  up. At low neutrino energy, MiniBooNE detected an excess  of events above the\r\n  Standard Model expectation and inconsistent with neutrino  oscillations. Its\r\n  source remains a mystery, which is best explored through  a more sensitive\r\n  detector. To this end, I am involved in the MicroBooNE  experiment, which is\r\n  developing a state-of-the-art detector that makes use of  liquid Argon. The\r\n  MicroBooNE detector will have bubble-chamber-like  resolution of particle\r\n  tracks. This experiment will run in 2013 at Fermi National  Accelerator\r\n  Laboratory.</p>\r\n<p>At the same time, I am also involved in exploring for  unobserved\r\n  transmutation modes. While many combinations of  oscillations between\r\n  neutrinos have been observed, there is one which is yet  to be seen. The\r\n  purpose of the Double Chooz experiment, on which I  collaborates, is to\r\n  observe, for the first time, this rare transmutation of  anti-electron\r\n  neutrinos. This experiment will begin taking data in  2010. The results will\r\n  help us flesh out our newly-forming model of particle  physics which\r\n  incorporates neutrino mass.</p>\r\n", "department": "Physics", "keywords": ["Experimental Nuclear and Particle Physics", "High Energy Physics"]},

In its most familiar phases, string  theory reduces to a perturbative theory of quantum gravity. These  phases are useful for studying, for example, the resolution of  singularities in classical gravity, or the set of possibilities for the  geometry and fields of spacetime. Along these lines, Adams is  particularly interested in microscopic quantization of flux vacua, and  in the search for constraints on low-energy physics derived from  consistency of the stringy UV completion.</p>\r\n    <p>In  other phases, when the gravitational interactions become strong and a  smooth spacetime geometry ceases to be a good approximation, a more  convenient description of string theory may be given in terms of a  weakly-coupled non-gravitational quantum field theory. Remarkably,\u00a0  these two descriptions\u2014with and without gravity\u2014appear to be completely  equivalent, with one remaining weakly-coupled when its dual is strongly  interacting. This equivalence, known as gauge-gravity duality, allows  us to study strongly-coupled string and quantum field theories by  studying perturbative features of their weakly-coupled duals.  Gauge-gravity duals have already led to interesting predictions for the  quark-gluon plasma studied at RHIC. A major focus of Adams's present  research is to use such dualities to find weakly-coupled descriptions  of strongly-interacting condensed matter systems which can be realized  in the lab.</p>\r\n\r\n", "department": "Physics", "keywords": ["Theoretical Particle  Physics", "String Theory"]},

The hadronic part of                 this soup was a dense collection of quarks and gluons. Matter was                 in a phase called a Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). This soup expanded                 and cooled. At about a microsecond, when the universe was about                 the size of the solar system, the universe went through a transition                 (probably a phase transition). The quarks and gluons coalesced into                 globules of hadronic matter. For the first time hadrons (<i>e. g.</i> protons, neutrons, pions) were formed. Professor Busza and his group                 are trying to recreate and study in the laboratory, on a small scale,                 this transition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a big collider called RHIC at the Brookhaven National Laboratory,                 nuclei as heavy as gold are accelerated to almost the speed of light                 and made to collide head on with each other. In the process, unprecedented                 energy and matter densities are created, large enough, Prof. Busza                 believes, to create the QGP. Such collisions are made to occur in                 four locations around the RHIC collider. The Busza group has surrounded                 one of the interaction regions with a sophisticated instrument with                 which they can look at the consequences of the collisions. They                 hope to see evidence of the formation of a QGP and then study how                 it decays back into ordinary hadronic matter. This will teach us                 not only something about the history of the universe at a millionth                 of a second after the big bang, but also about the properties of                 hadronic matter and of the vacuum.
