SEBENIUS specializes in analyzing and advising on complex negotiations.  He holds the Gordon Donaldson Professorship of Business Administration at Harvard Business School.  In 1993, he took the lead in the School's decision--unique among major business schools--to make negotiation a required course in the MBA Program and to create a Negotiation Unit (department) which he headed for several years.  The Negotiation Unit grew to several full-time negotiation faculty teaching the required course to over  800 students per year as well as offering advanced dealmaking and negotiation courses to MBAs, doctoral students, and executives.  The Negotiation Unit subsequently merged with the School's Organization and Markets Unit to form a new Unit, \"Negotiation, Organizations, and Markets (NOM).\"  Formerly an Associate Professor on the faculty of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, Sebenius also currently serves as Vice Chair and as a member of the Executive Committee of the Program on Negotiation (PON) at Harvard Law School.  At PON, he has taken the lead role in the University's annual Great Negotiator Award program, which has intensively engaged with and brought negotiators such as George Mitchell and Richard Holbrooke to campus.  </p> <p>Early in his career, he co-founded the Negotiation Roundtable, an ongoing forum in which hundreds of varied negotiations have been examined to extract their most valuable lessons. In 2008, Sebenius succeeded Roger Fisher as Director of the Harvard Negotiation Project, which currently focuses on China-related negotiations, the Middle East Negotiation Initiative, and the Great Negotiator Study Initiative. \u00a0Drawing on this and extensive advisory experience, summarized below,  he co-authored (with David Lax) 3-D Negotiation: Powerful Tools to Change the Game in Your Most Important Deals (HBS Press).  A previous collaboration with Lax produced The Manager as Negotiator (The Free Press).

Arthur Fellowship, an appointment supporting the research and teaching of business ethics, and a Marvin Bower Fellowship, an appointment to help faculty launch innovative new research agendas. Additionally, Karthik is a faculty associate in the <a href=\"http://www.wcfia.harvard.edu/node/7525\">Weatherhead Center for International Affairs</a> in Harvard\u2019s Faculty of Arts &amp; Sciences and an associate editor of the <a href=\"http://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-accounting-and-economics/\"><em>Journal of Accounting &amp; Economics</em></a>. Karthik teaches\u00a0the first-year M.B.A. course \u201cLeadership and Corporate Accountability,\u201d where he is particularly involved in studying the responsibilities of business leaders worldwide in lobbying regulators and combating corruption.

The first is the political economy of accounting standard-setting. Accounting standards, in facilitating resource allocation across competing ventures, are central to the functioning of complex economies. Karthik\u2019s research examines how corporate lobbying, regulatory ideologies, power politics, and other political incentives interact to shape the nature of accounting standards and financial reports. He has explored these ideas both in the U.S. (e.g., through studies of the Financial Accounting Standards Board) and in the context of accounting\u2019s globalization, as seen through countries\u2019 adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards. Karthik is also interested in the political economy of various conceptual ideas in accounting such as accounting conservatism and fair-value accounting.</p>\r\n<p>The second field of Karthik\u2019s research is corporate accountability. Motivated by evidence of special-interest capture of the accounting standard-setting process in the U.S. and abroad, he is interested in examining business leaders\u2019 broader responsibilities to society, particularly when engaging in public policy. This stream of research explores, across countries, the role of transparency as an instrument of accountability, particularly in addressing corruption and building responsible models of corporate lobbying. The central thesis here is that theories of transparency from accounting can be applied to develop and improve systems of corporate accountability.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Karthik has published several articles and case studies in his areas of interest, including in <em>Accounting, Economics &amp; Law</em>,\u00a0<em>Accounting Horizons</em>, <em>The Accounting Review</em>,<em>\u00a0Harvard Business Review</em>,<em>\u00a0Journal of Accounting &amp; Economics</em>,\u00a0<em>Journal of Accounting Research</em>, and <em>Review of Accounting Studies</em>.

His book, <em>Competitive Strategy: Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors</em>, is in its 63rd printing and has been translated into 19 languages. His second major strategy book, <em>Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance</em>, was published in 1985 and is in its 38th printing. His book <em>On Competition</em> (2008) contains his most influential articles on strategy and competition, including the award-winning <em>Harvard Business Review</em> article 'What is Strategy?' (1996) and 'The Five Competitive Forces That Shape Strategy' (2008), a revised and extended version of his classic article on industry analysis. Professor Porter\u2019s next major book on strategy is in process.</p>\r\n<h3>Competitiveness of Nations and Regions</h3>\r\n<p>Professor Porter's 1990 book, <em>The Competitive Advantage of Nations</em>, presents a new theory of how nations and regions compete and their sources of economic prosperity. Motivated by his appointment by President Ronald Reagan to the President's Commission on Industrial Competitiveness, the book has guided economic policy in countless nations and regions. Subsequent articles have expanded on the concept of clusters (geographic concentrations of related industries that occur in particular fields) and other aspects of the theory.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>National Competitiveness</em></span>. Professor Porter has published books about national competitiveness covering New Zealand, Canada, Sweden, and Switzerland. His book <em>Can Japan Compete?</em> (2000) challenged long-held views about the Japanese economic miracle.</p>\r\n<p>Professor Porter chairs the <em>Global Competitiveness Report</em>, an annual ranking of the competitiveness and growth prospects of more than 120 countries published by the World Economic Forum.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Clusters</em></span>. Professor Porter\u2019s ideas on clusters, first introduced in 1990, have given rise to a large body of theory and practice throughout the world. Cluster-based economic development thinking has resulted in many hundreds of public-private cluster initiatives in virtually every country. The article \u201cClusters and Competition: New Agendas for Companies, Governments, and Institutions\u201d and <em>On Competition</em> (1998) provide a summary.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Regional Competitiveness</em></span>. Professor Porter extended his work on competitiveness to states, provinces, and other sub-national regions. He led the <a href=\"http://www.compete.org/nri/clusters_innovation.asp\">Clusters of Innovation project</a> which developed a framework for economic policy in U.S. regions. He also created the <a title=\"U.S. Cluster Mapping Project\" href=\"http://clustermapping.us\" target=\"_blank\">U.S.\u00a0Cluster Mapping Project</a>, which provides rich data on the economic geography of U.S. regions and clusters on an interactive website and received grant funding from the U.S. Department of Commerce's Economic Development Administration. Professor Porter\u2019s methodology is the basis for comprehensive new data on the economic geography of the 27 countries of the European Union. The article \u2018The Economic Performance of Regions\u2019 (2003) summarizes some of the important findings from this data, and a new paper, \u2018Convergence, Clusters and Economic Performance\u2019 (2006), with Mercedes Delgado and Scott Stern, presents the first comprehensive statistical examination of U.S. regional performance using cluster data.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Innovation</em></span>. Professor Porter is co-author (with Professor Scott Stern and others) of a body of work on the sources of innovation in national and regional economies, including <em>The New Challenge to America's Prosperity: Findings from the Innovation Index</em> (1999), 'The Determinants of National Innovative Capacity' (2000), and 'Measuring the 'Ideas' Production Function: Evidence from International Patent Output' (2000).</p>\r\n<h3>Competition and Society</h3>\r\n<p>Professor Porter's third major body of work has addressed the relationship between competition and important social issues such as poverty and the natural environment.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Economically Distressed Communities</em></span>. Professor Porter offered a new approach to revitalizing distressed urban communities, beginning with the <em>Harvard Business Review</em> article 'The Competitive Advantage of the Inner City'. In 1994, he founded <a href=\"http://www.icic.org/\">The Initiative for a Competitive Inner City</a> (ICIC), a non-profit, private-sector organization to catalyze inner-city business development across the country. Professor Porter is Chairman of the ICIC, a national organization that works in cities across America. Professor Porter has also written on economic development in rural areas.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>The Natural Environment</em></span>. Professor Porter introduced a controversial theory that environmental progress and economic competitiveness were not inconsistent but complementary, first put forth in his <em>Scientific American</em> essay, 'America's Green Strategy' (1991), and developed in more detail in his article 'Toward a New Conception of the Environment-Competitiveness Relationship' (1995). The \u201cPorter Hypothesis\u201d has been the subject of more than 100 articles and has spawned a rich literature.

Questions that drive his inquires include: How can companies grow in reach and profit, while staying true to a social mission and maintaining their quality of services or products? And, should social entrepreneurs focus their efforts on leading change of the broader system in which they operate, or should they focus on achieving impact within the existing system?

Prior to attending graduate school, he worked as a founding member of <a href=\"www.ctp.com\">Cambridge Technology Partners</a> in Sales and Marketing.</p>\r\n<p>Professor Khurana's research uses a sociological perspective to focus on the processes by which elites and leaders are selected and developed. He has written extensively about the CEO labor market with a particular interest on: the factors that lead to vacancies in the CEO position; the factors that affect the choice of successor; the role of market intermediaries such as executive search firms in CEO search; and the consequences of CEO succession and selection decisions for subsequent firm performance and strategic choices. He has published articles on Corp. Governance in the Harvard Business and Sloan Management Review. His book on the CEO labor market, <em><a href=\"www.pup.princeton.edu/titles/7338.htmlwww\">Searching for a Corporate Savior: The Irrational Quest for Charismatic CEOs </a></em>(Princeton University Press). The book is an analysis of the labor market for CEOs.</p>\r\n<p>In the book Khurana explains the basic mechanics of the market, how it differs from other labor markets, how it has changed in the past twenty years, and whether it is successful in placing the best candidates in the available jobs. He focuses on the growing tendency of boards of directors to ignore candidates inside their firms and to hire CEOs from outside. He seeks to show that this trend has emerged not because of the intrinsic merits of the \u201cexternal market,\u201d but because of the rise of investor capitalism and despite evidence that reliance on this market for CEO succession and executive compensation has serious problems that may threaten the viability of firms and the legitimacy of market capitalism.</p>\r\n<p>Khurana's subsequent research grows out of the same interests in the social context of business leadership and the allocation of leadership positions that motivated his research on the CEO labor market. His 2008 book, <em><a title=\"From Higher Aims\" href=\"http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8463.html\">From Higher Aims to Hired Hands: The Social Transformation of American Business Schools and the Unfulfilled Promise of Management as a Profession</a></em> (2007: Princeton University Press), chronicles the evolution of management as a profession, with particular focus on the institutional development of the MBA. The focus of this book lies in its direct bearing on the question of how professional management has claimed and received legitimation for its role as the steward of a very substantial proportion of society\u2019s material wealth and resources\u2014a role that has itself been subject to changing interpretations over the decades since the phenomenon of professional management first appeared on the American scene.\u00a0Guiding questions in this research stream include: Where did our current shareholder-centered, agency-based view of the role of professional management come from\u2014particularly in light of the very different one that underlay the founding of the first professional business schools and the granting to them of a place within the university? How does our current view of the role of the professional manager compare with the way that professional responsibility has traditionally been conceived in the other professions? In view of the way that professional roles have recently been evolving in professions such as law or medicine, do market forces inevitably undermine professional autonomy and standards? What would be the potential benefits and drawbacks of management becoming more like the other professions in its structure and culture than it has been during its history to date? Khurana's work argues that without a re-commitment to the professionalization project, business schools risk devolving into narrow vocation schools and serving largely as a credentialing system, ultimately weakening the legitimacy of MBA programs and contributing to a business culture that garners low trust and low legitimacy in society.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8463.html\">From Higher Aims to Hired Hands</a> received the American Sociological Association's Max Weber Book Award in 2008 for most outstanding contribution to scholarship in the past two years. In 2007, the book was also the Winner of the 2007 Best Professional/Scholarly Publishing Book in Business, Finance and Management, Association of American Publishers.</p>\r\n<p>Khurana has also been working with Dean Nitin Nohria to help legitimate the study of leadership as a multi-disciplinary field. Despite the fact that most business schools have \"leadership\" in their mission, the field is not regarded as a legitimate field of academic study.

She received her Ph.D. in Marketing, with distinction, from Columbia Business School. Professor Keinan is the winner of the 2011 JCR Ferber Award. Her work has been chosen by the New York Times as one of the \"Best Ideas of 2006,\"\u00a0and as\u00a0a finalist for the Journal of Consumer Research 2009 best paper award.\u00a0Her research on consumer behavior has been published in the leading marketing, psychology, and managerial journals, and featured in hundreds of\u00a0media outlets, including NPR, CNN, FOX, CBS, NBC, ABC, The Wall Street Journal, The New Yorker, Scientific American, BusinessWeek, Financial Times, Forbes, TIME, Boston Globe, Washington Post, Slate Magazine, Wired Magazine, Associated Press,\u00a0and United Press International.

At HBS, she teaches a new elective MBA course on Luxury Marketing.</p>\r\n<p>Professor Keinan\u2019s research interests include Branding, Luxury Marketing, Symbolic Consumption, Consumer self-Control, Regret, Fairness and Ethics in Marketing, and the Consumption of Experiences. One stream of research examines consumer's regrets and shows that in the long run, choosing work over play leads to regrets about having missed out on the pleasures of life. Her research demonstrates that while in the short-term it appears preferable to act responsibly and choose virtue over vice, over time such righteous behavior generates increasing regret. Her research further demonstrates that anticipating distant-future regret may help individuals who chronically deprive themselves of hedonism to realize and remedy this tendency.</p>\r\n<p>Professor Keinan has also examined why consumers desire unusual and extreme consumption experiences that may actually be unpleasant and even aversive. Examples include consumers who voluntarily stay at ice hotels, where they sleep on beds made of ice in freezing temperatures, and consumers who eat at restaurants serving peculiar foods, such as bacon ice cream and chocolate truffles with vinegar and anchovies. Her research demonstrates that such preferences represent a broader phenomenon, whereby consumers derive utility from collecting memorable experiences, \"checking off\" items on their \"experiential check list,\" and building their \"experiential CV\".</p>\r\n<p>A native of Israel, she received a B.A. in Economics and Communication and an MBA (Dean's List and Magna cum Laude) from Tel-Aviv University.\u00a0 In addition to her academic background, Anat has served in the Intelligence Corps within the IDF, worked as an advertising manager for an Israeli financial services corporation, and served on the Board of Directors for an employment placement agency in Israel.</p>", "department": "Marketing", "keywords": ["brands and branding", "consumer psychology", "customer behavior", "decision-making", "marketing", "consumer goods", "consumer policy", "ethics", "pricing", "advertising", "consumer products", "entertainment", "fashion", "food", "hotels & motels", "marketing industry", "recreation", "restaurant", "tourism", "travel", "Israel", "Middle East", "United States"]},

Eccles first joined the faculty in 1979 and received tenure in 1989. He left in 1993 to work in the private sector and rejoined the faculty in 2007. Right after receiving tenure, Professor Eccles started doing research on corporate reporting, a topic which remains of great interest to him from a research, managerial practice, and public policy perspective. He has written three books on this subject, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The ValueReporting Revolution: Moving Beyond the Earnings Game</span> (with Robert H. Herz, E. Mary Keegan and David M. H. Phillips), <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Building Public Trust: The Future of Corporate Reporting</span> (with Samuel A. DiPiazza Jr.), and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">One Report: Integrated Reporting for a Sustainable Strategy</span> (with Michael P. Krzus), which is the first book on this subject.

His next book on the subject, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Integrated Reporting Movement: Meaning, Momentum, Motives, and Materiality</span> (with Michael P.

This book introduces the ideas of an annual board of directors \u201cStatement of Significant Audiences and Materiality\u201d and the \u201cSustainable Value Matrix.\u201d In developing these ideas, Professor Eccles worked closely with Mr. Tim Youmans. \u00a0He and Professor Eccles are now writing a book with the working title of \u201cThe Meaning of Materiality\u201d which will be an in depth treatment of the ideas introduced in <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Integrated Reporting Movement </span>and will include a public policy perspective on the important but elusive concept of materiality.

Dolan is the Baker Foundation Professor at Harvard Business School. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Rochester and began his academic career in 1976 as a faculty member at the Graduate School of Business of the University of Chicago. He joined the Harvard Business School faculty in 1980 and became the Edward W. Carter Professor of Business Administration. He served as the Chairman of the Marketing area from 1986 to 1994. He has also been a visiting professor at IESE in Barcelona, Spain.<br><br>In 2001, he became the Dean of the University of Michigan Business School in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The School offered the broadest portfolio of degree programs among the leading business schools with the following degrees: Bachelor's of Business Administration, MBA (offered in five different formats - Day, Evening, Weekend, Executive and Global), Master's in Supply Chain Management, Master's in Accounting, and Ph.D.\u00a0 In addition, the School collaborated with two schools at the University to offer two joint Master's programs - the Erb Program in Sustainability (joint with the School of Natural Resources and Environment) and the Tauber Program on Global Operations (joint with the College of Engineering).<br><br>Under Dolan's leadership, the School embarked on a strategy of differentiation via a focus on action-based learning where teams of students undertook\u00a0field-based projects under the supervision of the faculty. For MBA students, this took the form of the Multidisciplinary Action Project (MAP) program in which two months at the end of the first year required courses were dedicated to working on high level projects with leading companies around the world. To afford students an opportunity for a global experience, over half the projects were outside the United States. These projects were deliberately not pre-defined for the students, affording them the opportunity to define issues and operate in an \"opportunity sensing\" rather just \"problem solving\" mode. As a result of these investments in innovative action-learning programs, the School was twice named the Best MBA Program in the world by the Wall Street Journal, based on their polling of recruiters. The Aspen Institute recognized the school as the best in training on issues of sustainability. To obtain the financial resources to support this strategy and the needed infrastructure, the School embarked on a Capital Campaign, raising nearly $400 million, including the $100 million dollar gift obtained by Dolan from Stephen M Ross, a New York real estate developer. At the time, it was the largest gift ever made to a\u00a0business school and still is the largest ever given to the University of Michigan. The Schools is now known as the Ross School of Business. While at Michigan, Dolan was also President of the William Davidson Institute for Global Economies and the Zell-Lurie Institute for Entrepreneurial Studies.

One of his cases, Sealed Air Corporation, with sales of over 300,000 copies, was recently designated by Harvard as one of the three \"classics\" in the Harvard collection. He has consulted with and provided executive education for leading firms throughout the world including General Electric, IBM and Henkel.

Cuddy is Associate Professor and Hellman Faculty Fellow in the Negotiation, Organizations &amp; Markets Unit at Harvard Business School. She holds a PhD in Psychology from Princeton University and BA in Social Psychology from the University of Colorado. Prior to joining HBS, Professor Cuddy was an Assistant Professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, where she taught Leadership in Organizations in the MBA program and Research Methods in the doctoral program; and an Assistant Professor of Psychology at Rutgers University, where she taught Social Psychology. At Harvard, she has taught MBA courses on the psychology of persuasion, power, and negotiation, and in numerous executive education programs.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>Professor Cuddy studies the origins and outcomes of how we perceive and are influenced by other people, investigating the roles of variables such as stereotypes, emotions, nonverbal behaviors, and hormones.Her stereotyping research focuses on social categories (e.g., Asian Americans, elderly people, Latinos, working mothers) \u2013 how they are judged by others and by their own members (i.e., stereotyping), and how these judgments set the tone and content of social interactions (i.e., prejudice and discrimination). Along with Susan Fiske (Princeton University) and Peter Glick (Lawrence University), Cuddy developed the Stereotype Content Model (SCM) and the Behaviors from Intergroup Affect and Emotions (BIAS) Map, which focus on judgments of other people and groups along two core trait dimensions, warmth and competence, and how these judgments shape and motivate our social emotions, intentions, and behaviors.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>Cuddy\u2019s research with Dana Carney (UC-Berkeley) focuses on how nonverbal expressions of power (i.e., expansive, open, space-occupying postures) affect people\u2019s feelings, behaviors, and hormone levels. In particular, their research shows that \u201cfaking\u201d body postures associated with dominance and power (\u201cpower posing\u201d) \u2013 even for as little as two minutes \u2013 increases people\u2019s testosterone, decreases their cortisol, increases their appetite for risk, and causes them to perform better in job interviews. In short, as David Brooks summarized the findings, \u201cIf you act powerfully, you will begin to think powerfully.\u201d\u00a0Ultimately, Cuddy's research suggests that when people feel personally powerful, they become more present: better connected with their own thoughts and feelings, which helps them to better connect with the thoughts and feelings of others.
